<h1>Web Design and Web Development</h1>

<p>
This website is created as part of an HTML assignment.
The purpose of this website is to explain web design and web development.
This website is created using basic HTML for learning purposes.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Websites are used by many people every day.
They are used for learning, communication, business and entertainment.
To create a website, web design and web development are required.
HTML is the basic language used to create web pages.
</p>

<p>
HTML helps in structuring the content of a web page.
It allows us to add headings, paragraphs and images.
This makes it possible to display information on the internet.
</p>

<h2>What is Web Design?</h2>

<p>
Web design is about how a website looks.
It focuses on the appearance of a web page.
This includes layout, colors, images and text.
</p>

<p>
Web designers try to make websites attractive and easy to use.
A good design helps users understand the content easily.
Web design is important because it affects user experience.
</p>

<h2>Importance of Web Design</h2>

<p>
Web design helps users navigate a website easily.
A well-designed website looks professional.
It helps keep users interested in the website.
</p>

<p>
If a website is poorly designed, users may leave the site.
This shows that web design plays an important role in website creation.
</p>

<h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

<p>
Web development is about building and maintaining websites.
It focuses on how the website works.
Web developers make sure that website features function properly.
</p>

<p>
Web development involves using programming languages and tools.
It helps in adding functionality to websites.
Web development ensures that websites respond to user actions.
</p>

<h2>Front-End Development</h2>

<p>
Front-end development is the part of web development that users see.
It is also known as the client side of a website.
Front-end development deals with the layout, text, images and buttons.
</p>

<p>
HTML is mainly used in front-end development.
It helps structure the content shown on the browser.
Front-end developers focus on making the website easy to use.
</p>

<h2>Back-End Development</h2>

<p>
Back-end development is the part of web development that works behind the scenes.
Users do not see the back-end directly.
Back-end development deals with servers, databases and data processing.
</p>

<p>
The back-end helps store and retrieve information.
For example, when a user logs into a website, the back-end checks the details.
Back-end development ensures that the website works correctly.
</p>

<h2>Difference Between Front-End and Back-End</h2>

<p>
Front-end development focuses on what users see on the screen.
Back-end development focuses on how data is handled and stored.
Both front-end and back-end work together to create a website.
</p>

<p>
Without front-end, users cannot see the website.
Without back-end, the website cannot process information.
This shows that both are important in web development.
</p>
